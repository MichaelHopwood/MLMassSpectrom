ML applications on mass spectrometry data

## How to run

Run an experiment by customizing `Classify.py`, then run using

`python Classify.py`

## Other files

`synthetic_spectrometry.ipynb` was used for initial development of simulations, which was later abstracted into `core.py`.

`core.py` contains all source code for simulations, neural networks, and visualizations.
